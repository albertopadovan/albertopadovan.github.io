*** The Harmonic Resolvent Framework ***

We introduce the harmonic resolvent framework as a tool to study the amplification mechanisms and triadic frequency interactions in nonlinear fluid flows that evolve in the proximity of time-periodic orbits.
Examples of such flows include wake flows (e.g., flows over airfoils, cylinders etc.), jets and mixing layer at moderately low Reynolds number, flows in turbomachinery and rotorcraft, as well as flows found in biological systems (e.g., blood flow).
The harmonic resolvent operator can be understood as a frequency-domain input-output operator that governs how a fluid flow responds to harmonic excitation, and it can be used to dissect the
