**The Harmonic Resolvent Framework for Time-Periodic Fluid Flows**

Fluid flows that exhibit time-periodic behavior, or that evolve in the proximity of time-periodic orbits, are ubiquitous in nature and engineering.
Some examples include wake flows, jets and mixing layers at moderately low Reynolds number, flows in turbomachinery and rotorcraft, as well as some wall-bounded laminar and turbulent flows. 
In this work, we introduce the harmonic resolvent framework as a tool to study the amplification mechanisms and triadic frequency interactions in nonlinear fluid flows that evolve in the proximity of time-periodic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation.
The harmonic resolvent operator can be understood as a frequency-domain linear input-output operator that governs how a fluid flow responds to harmonic excitation.
We show that studying the structure of this operator allows to extract insightful information on the physics of the underlying fluid, and to develop reduced-order models for prediction and control.
