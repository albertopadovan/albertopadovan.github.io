## About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Professor [Daniel Bodony](http://acoustics.ae.illinois.edu/) in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
More specifically, I am part of the Center for Hypersonics & Entry Systems Studies ([CHESS](https://chess.grainger.illinois.edu/)), where I focus on the development of computational and theoretical methods for the analysis and model reduction of high-speed fluid flows over ablating materials.
<br>

I obtained my Ph.D. from Princeton University under the supervision of Professor [Clarence Rowley](https://cwrowley.princeton.edu/), and my dissertation work focused on the development of a frequency-domain formalism for the analysis, model reduction and control of fluid flows that exhibit time-periodic dynamics.
<br>

My research is computational and theoretical in nature and, broadly speaking, I am interested in studying and modelling complex fluid flows through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory.
