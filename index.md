## About Me
<p align="justify">
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Professor <a href="http://acoustics.ae.illinois.edu/">Daniel Bodony</a> in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
More specifically, I am part of the Center for Hypersonics & Entry Systems Studies (<a href="https://chess.grainger.illinois.edu/">CHESS</a>), where I focus on the development of computational and theoretical methods for the analysis and model reduction of high-speed fluid flows over ablating materials.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I obtained my Ph.D. from Princeton University under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cwrowley.princeton.edu/">Clarence Rowley</a>, and my dissertation work focused on the development of a frequency-domain formalism for the analysis, model reduction and control of fluid flows that exhibit time-periodic dynamics.
</p>

My research is computational and theoretical in nature and, broadly speaking, I am interested in studying and modelling complex fluid flows through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory.
