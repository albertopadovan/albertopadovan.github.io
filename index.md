## Research

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Professor [Daniel Bodony](http://acoustics.ae.illinois.edu/) in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Currently, I am focusing on the development of computational and theoretical frameworks for the analysis and model reduction of high-speed fluid flows over ablating materials.
I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, under the supervision of Professor [Clarence Rowley](https://cwrowley.princeton.edu/).
My dissertation work focused on the development of frequency-domain methods for the analysis, model reduction and control of fluid flows that exhibit time-periodic dynamics.
My research is computational and theoretical in nature and, broadly speaking, I am interested in studying and modelling complex fluid flows through the lens of dynamical systems and controls systems theory.
