## About Me
<p align="justify">
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working with Professor <a href="http://acoustics.ae.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Daniel Bodony</a> in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
Currently, I am focusing on the development of data-driven model reduction methods for fluid flows, as well as on the development and implementation of reduced-order controllers for supersonic and hypersonic wall-bounded flows.
I am also part of the Center for Hypersonics & Entry Systems Studies (<a href="https://chess.grainger.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">CHESS</a>), where I contribute to the analysis and modelling of high-speed fluid flows over ablating materials.

<p align="justify">
I obtained my Ph.D. from Princeton University under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cwrowley.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Clarence Rowley</a>, and my dissertation work focused on the development of a frequency-domain formalism for the analysis, model reduction and control of fluid flows that exhibit time-periodic dynamics.

My research is computational and theoretical in nature and, broadly speaking, I am interested in studying and modelling complex fluid flows through the lens of dynamical systems and control theory.
